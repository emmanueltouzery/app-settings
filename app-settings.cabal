synopsis:            A library to manage application settings (INI file-like)
description:         
  A library to deal with application settings.
  .
  This library deals with read-write application settings.
  You will have to specify the settings that your application
  uses, their name, types and default values.
  .
  Setting types must implement the 'Read' and 'Show' typeclasses. 
  .
  The settings are saved in a file in an INI-like key-value format
  (without sections).
  .
  Reading and updating settings is done in pure code, the IO
  monad is only used to load settings and save them to disk.
  It is advised for the user to create a module in your project
  holding settings handling.
  .
  You can then declare settings:
  . 
  > fontSize :: Setting Double
  > fontSize = Setting "fontSize" 14
  > 
  > dateFormat :: Setting String
  > dateFormat = Setting "dateFormat" "%x"
  > 
  > backgroundColor :: Setting (Int, Int, Int)
  > backgroundColor = Setting "backcolor" (255, 0, 0)
  .
  Optionally you can declare the list of all your settings:
  .
  > defaultConfig :: DefaultConfig
  > defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig $ do
  >     setting fontSize
  >     setting dateFormat
  >     setting backgroundColor
  .
  If you do it, 'saveSettings' will also save settings
  which have not been modified, which are still at their
  default value in the configuration file, in a commented
  form, as a documentation to the user who may open the
  configuration file.
  So for instance if you declare this default configuration
  and have set the font size to 16 but left the other
  settings untouched, the configuration file which will be
  saved will be:
  .
  > fontSize=16
  > # dateFormat="%x"
  > # backcolor=(255,0,0)
  .
  If you did not specify the list of settings, only the
  first line would be present in the configuration file.
  .
  Once we declared the settings, we can read the configuration
  from disk (and your settings module should export your wrapper
  around the function offered by this library):
  .
  > readResult <- try $ readSettings (AutoFromAppName "test")
  > case readResult of
  > 	Right (conf, GetSetting getSetting) -> do
  > 		let textSize = getSetting textSizeFromWidth
  > 		saveSettings getDefaultConfig (AutoFromAppName "test") conf
  > 	Left (x :: SomeException) -> error "Error reading the config file!"
  .
  'AutoFromAppName' specifies where to save the configuration file.
  And we've already covered the getSetting in this snippet, see 
  the 'readSettings' documentation for further information.
